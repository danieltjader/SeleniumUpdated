# SeleniumUpdated

Includes some small automation of the sites; 
- ActiTime: Setting up and preparing a trial account
- Adlibris: Adding a book to the cart, and goes to checkout
- Google: Searches for a String

To run the project, you need to have the selenium jar files on your computer, and add the dependencies for them.
